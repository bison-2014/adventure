Description:
This is a basic Rails app based on the design and functionality of Imgur. We'll be using only animal pictures that users can upload via a url link. Users can upvote and downvote pictures, comment on pictures, upvote/downvote comments, search pictures by tags and titles, and sort pictures by popularity.

How to Use the App:
Animaux! (or Adventure) is very similar to the popular website Imgur. Users can upload photos, upvote and downvote other photos, comment and reply to comments on photo posts, and upvote/downvote comments and replies.  Users can see their own photos, sort by popularity, sort by most recent, and delete their uploaded photos.
